The Appropriate Administrator will conduct a Preliminary Review to determine if the Retaliation Complaint will be processed by the CO.

Allegations must be submitted in writing to ensure a clear understanding of the issues raised. Reasonable accommodations may be made for Complainants with disabilities.

The Retaliation Complaint must be received by the Appropriate Administrator within 12 calendar months of the most recent alleged act of Retaliation.¹⁰ The Filing Date is the date the Retaliation Complaint was received by the Employee's supervisor, manager, or the Appropriate Administrator.
